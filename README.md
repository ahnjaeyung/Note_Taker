## Installation  
Clone repo and npm i.  
## Usage  
This application can be launched via the deployed live link on Heroku.  Once launched, the user is presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.  When the user clicks this link, they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column.  

When the user enters a new note title and the note's text, a *Save* icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.  When the user clicks this save icon, the new note that they entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.  

When the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column.  When the user clicks on the *Write* icon in the navigation at the top of the page, they are then presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column.  When the user clicks on the *Delete* icon next to an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note will be removed from the list.
